 
I was always curious why Zoey was classified as a gamer chick when I saw this image. 
Yeah she was more of a horror film nut.  Wouldn't put it past her though.
Because that's what we nerds hope gamer chicks look like?
Wouldn't college girl/student be more appropriate?
Her character is pretty much a nerd. She plays Resident Evil and stuff
Does she actually say that in game? I know Louis mentions counterstrike and thats like the only gaming reference I remember.
I'm more concerned that any survivors who had played l4d would friendly fire each other into the grave in a matter of 20 seconds.
"you took the last aid kit!!"

"nuh uh! your mom took it!"

pew pew pew
So... what if you're a an Old, Black, Gamer-Chick, who is also a prick? are you a super human survivor?
La-Fonda guuurl got some peels here.
In the many years since this comic was made, Left 4 Dead 2 has made the melee joke kind of irrelevant.
I could have sworn that the Hunter was actually a homeless junky that was hyped up on speed.... Oh well.
You mean what a re-post taught you?
This comic seems kind of whiny.
Zoey is a horror movie enthusiast!
eh, picking on video games for realism is too easy a target. Its not that Value can't make a realistic game, its just that realistic games aren't fun (for most people). Rainbow Six 3 Raven Shield is awesome but too realistic and not fast enough for some people so now all we get is Halo bullshit.
Try the ARMA games if you want a realistic FPS.
You should do more of those, that was great.  Call it the "what I learned" series.
Huh, the closet thing would be useful. Maybe I shouldn't have set my reality to "Realism Versus"
I miss the old survivors...and just having anyone I know play that Left 4 Dead.
I always thought the smoking thing was bull, since Bill smoked, and he was a bad ass!

But then he [dies in "The Passing"](/spoiler), which made me re-evaluate my thoughts on the matter...
you spoiler tag really does nothing to hide any [spoilers](/spoiler).
What Highschool of the Dead has taught me is that I should team up with huge breasted women in case of a Zombie Apocalypse.
The hunter looks strangely similar to Altair or Ezio.
